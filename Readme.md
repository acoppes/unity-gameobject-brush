GameObject palette + Brush for 2d Games

For the sake of having a good example, we are using the free asset pack provided at https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-rpg-pack, there is no intention of using it without credit, so if you like it, go there and buy it.

TODO:

* Palette size in editor.
* Brush logic for painting
  - Mouse drag + repeat, etc.
* Settings (asset) to configure prefab folders.
* Custom palette filters (assets).
* Cleanup stuff on scene save, load, etc.
* Select more than one prefab at the same time.

## Erase

* For now with key, if clicked while holding alt, then delete nearest object.
* While holding key or while erase selected, highlight the object that is going to be deleted?

## Undo

* After erase painted object.

## Brushes 

* Random Flip
* Random Size
* Paint multiple instances, random, distribute in area.
